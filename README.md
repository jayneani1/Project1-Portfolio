MVP:
- responsive nav 
- doc form for resume -- i cant find how to do this anywhere. I was able to make a scrollbox and put images in, but it wouldn't center and seemed impractical.
- updated portfolio projects

Post MVP: 
- animated javascript add ons.(ex in liana penns portfolio)
- creating unique backgrounds to have text written in/ around (like in linked inspo site) -- having an issue with this and screen sizes, but working on it
- custom background
